# Logic Circuit Simulator
This is a Project of a Logic Simulator/Designer made using c++ language, to help us apply programming techniques concept in a real life project. This project is a part of CMPN103 - Programming Techniques Course in CUFE curriculum.
It was aimed after the completion of this project that we will be able to:
- Apply OOP concepts like Encapsulation, the Insulation of classes and Polymorphism
- Enhance our C++ knowledge
- Interact with GUI library
- Code organization and how that could help the integration process
- Distribute work load and calloborating with a team in a project


## More about the project
This application should help a user draw a logic circuit using different components, connect them with connections, add switches to control inputs and LEDs to monitor outputs, save and load a
circuit, and so on. The application should accept input from the user as mouse clicks or key strokes and then take actions according to the input.
More about the project requirements description can be found in this [document](Project%20Requirements%20F2020.pdf).

## Environment and technologies
The project was mainly c++ and we used CMU GUI library.
